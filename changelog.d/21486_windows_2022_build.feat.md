The Vector CI now uses
the [Windows Server 2022 image](https://github.com/actions/runner-images/blob/main/images/windows/Windows2022-Readme.md)
for Vector builds. Also, the publish workflow is now
using [WiX Toolset v3.14.1](https://github.com/wixtoolset/wix3/releases/tag/wix3141rtm) for packaging.
